Week 2 LearnITGirl

TestBlog is the first blog created by me using Django.

The blog provides functionality of viewing blog posts, adding new blog posts and editing existing blog posts.
It also includes security features so that changes can be made only by an authenticated user.
This was created using the DjangoGirls.org tutorial.
